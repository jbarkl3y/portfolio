    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am an intrepid traveler who loves <strong>fly fishing</strong>, the <strong>outdoors</strong>, and <strong>technology</strong>. I work as a System Administrator as well as a freelance web developer.</p>
    <p>I also love bluegrass music and play the Guitar, Banjo, and Mandolin. I play in a family band that my brother and I started called <strong>The Fellow Travelers</strong>.</p>
    <p>Travel and exploring the outdoors is one of my great passions in life. When I am out deep in a forest or high on a mountain top I get some of the best inspiration to help me achieve my professional and personal goals.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I come from a logging town called Longview, WA. It resides in the Southwestern part of the state about 30 minutes inland from the coast. I love being in the forests or exploring old logging roads. Growing up in a mill town you learn hard work and dedication early on in your life.</p>
    <p>I graduated from BYU-Idaho with a B.S. in Computer Information Technology.</p>
